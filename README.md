# RedditTikTokCreator

This little project is a quick-and-dirty Python script that grabs a Reddit thread, downloads the video, sends the text through a TTS engine, and sticks it all on top of a video game background. It's more of a proof-of-concept than a polished tool - expect a few rough edges and some duct tape here and there.

## How It Works

1. Using reddit api, it browse selected sub-reddit/
2. Selects Top threads for the last day, and filters out NSFW (configurable).
4. Uses a TTS engine to turn the text into speech using tiktok tts api.
5. Smashes everything together on a video game backdrop.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and run the script. This isn't a maintained project, so there might be some quirks and bumps along the way.
